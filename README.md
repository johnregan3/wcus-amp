# WCUS AMP Plugin

<img src="/img/amp-and-wp-header.jpg" />

### Overview
This repo includes both a fully-functional plugin that demonstrates how to customize the default template provided by Automattic's AMP plugin, as well as many code samples showing how you can do this in your own projects.

This plugin is written for a planned talk at [WordCamp US](https://2016.us.wordcamp.org).
[Slides for this talk are available here](http://bit.ly/WCUS-AMP).

### Detail

The main plugin file, [<code>wcus-amp.php</code>](https://github.com/johnregan3/wcus-amp/blob/master/wcus-amp.php), contains documentation and basic functions to help add AMP support to your WordPress theme.

[<code>/samples</code>](https://github.com/johnregan3/wcus-amp/tree/master/samples) is a directory of example usage of each piece of functionality, including some that aren't used in the plugin itself.

### Installation

This plugin installs just as any typical WordPress plugin.  Place it in your plugins directory, then navigate to Plugins in the WP admin menu, then Activate it.</a>
<em>Note that this plugin requires the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/amp">AMP Plugin</a> by Automattic to function.</em>
